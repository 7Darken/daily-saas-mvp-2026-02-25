## 📧 EMAIL TEMPLATE (Personalized Per Creator)

### Subject Line Ideas (A/B Test):
```
[Short] "Quick Partnership: MentalClear + [Creator Name]"
[Curious] "Your burnout story + our tool = something real?"
[Direct] "Creator collaboration: Free premium + revenue share"
```

---

## 📧 EMAIL BODY (Generic Template - Customize Per Creator)

```
Hi [Creator Name],

I'm [Founder Name], building MentalClear — an AI wellness app for remote workers.

I've followed your [TikTok/Instagram/Twitter] for a while, and your content about 
[specific topic: designer burnout / founder wellness / remote work] resonates deeply. 
You're doing the exact opposite of toxic positivity: telling the truth.

That's rare. That's why I'm reaching out.

---

### What MentalClear Does:
- 1-min daily check-in (Name your stress, sleep, focus)
- AI pattern matching (See your burnout patterns over 7 days)
- 5-10 min personalized meditations
- Free forever (with optional premium for chat IA + expert access)

47% of remote workers are burned out. Most wellness apps avoid the topic.
We lean into it.

---

### What I'm Proposing:

[OPTION A - For Designers/Storytellers] (@BurnoutSophie, @VieRemote)
**Free Premium Access + Creative Freedom**
- Full premium access for you + 10 followers/friends
- No script approval, no content rules (just authenticity)
- Monthly check-in: share what your audience needs
- Goal: Integrate MentalClear into your wellness content naturally

[OPTION B - For Founders/Builders] (@FondateurFranceAI, @MindsetTech)
**Revenue Share Model**
- You get 10-15% commission on every premium conversion from your audience
- Monthly payout (PayPal/Stripe)
- Your unique referral link (track your impact)
- Goal: Build a sustainable partnership

[OPTION C - For Communities/Newsletters] (@BeWellFr)
**Cross-Promotion + Featured Access**
- Feature in our "Creator Series" content
- Free premium tier for your newsletter subscribers
- Podcast/guest interview opportunity
- Co-created content (burnout manifesto, wellness guide)

---

### Why I Think This Works:

Your audience:
- Already cares about mental health (pre-qualified)
- Trusts you (authentic voice)
- Needs solutions (you point to them, we provide them)

Our app:
- Free core (no barrier to try)
- Privacy-first (no data selling, CNIL compliant)
- Made in France (local, not just another US SaaS)

Both:
- Lean into honesty about burnout (no fake positivity)
- Serve remote workers specifically
- Want to build culture change (not just extract value)

---

### Next Steps:

If this resonates, I'd love to:
1. Send you free premium access (48h)
2. Jump on a quick 20-min call (Friday or next week)
3. Brainstorm 1-2 pieces of content together
4. Agree on terms (option A, B, or C above)

No pressure. If this isn't the right time or fit, I totally understand.

But if you care about this space as much as I do, let's build something real.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

[Founder Name]  
MentalClear Founder

[Your Twitter/LinkedIn]

P.S. — If you have questions about the app, metrics, or how we think about this, 
I'm an open book. Ask anything.
