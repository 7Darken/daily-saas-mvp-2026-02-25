## 📱 REDDIT THREADS (5 posts, Tue-Fri stagger)

### Thread #1: "Remote Work Sucks" (Tue 9 AM CET)
**Subreddit:** r/TeleTravailleurs
**Title:** "Les télétravailleurs burnent à mort - et on en parle pas assez"

**Post:**
> 47% of us are burned out. Nobody talks about it. Everyone's pretending remote work is a vacation.
>
> It's isolation. It's the always-on culture. It's zoom fatigue mixed with imposter syndrome.
>
> I burned out 3 years ago and swore I'd never let it happen again. So I built a stupid simple tool: 1 minute check-in per day. That's it.
>
> Stress today? Sleep quality? Focus level? Just rate it 1-10. Takes 60 seconds. You see your patterns after 5 days, not 6 months of therapy.
>
> Been using it with 50 friends for 2 months. The ones who build a 7-day streak? They notice patterns nobody else sees: "Tuesday afternoons destroy me" or "when I sleep 7+ hours, my focus is +40%".
>
> Not selling motivation. Not selling meditation apps (god, we have enough). Just... visibility. Patterns. Your own data.
>
> Any other remote workers tired of pretending everything's fine? What's your burnout trigger?

**Comments strategy:** Lead with story (mine), ask open question, reply thoughtfully within 24h

### Thread #2: "Patterns Over Symptoms" (Wed 9 AM CET)
**Subreddit:** r/AskFrance
**Title:** "Comment j'ai compris mes patterns de burnout grâce à des données"

**Post:**
> Headline: Data-driven approach to recognizing burnout before it hits.
>
> I tracked 4 variables for 30 days: Daily stress (1-10), sleep hours, focus level, and one custom metric (mine was "did I work after 8 PM").
>
> After week 1: No pattern visible.
> After week 2: Noticed Monday stress always 7+, Wednesday was baseline.
> After week 3: HOLY SHIT. Days I sleep <6 hours = +3 stress next day. ALWAYS.
> After week 4: Pattern confirmed. Now I defend my sleep like my life depends on it.
>
> **Before:** "I feel burned out but IDK why" (therapist: €100/session)
> **After:** "Tuesday + low sleep = burnout spiral. Friday I'm always okay if I sleep 8h Thursday" (free data)
>
> Boring AF, but it works. Anyone else track their own wellness data? What patterns surprised you?

**Engagement:** Story → data → questions (invite others to share patterns)

### Thread #3: "Burnout Confession" (Thu 2 PM CET)
**Subreddit:** r/Startup
**Title:** "I built an AI wellness app for remote workers after burning out myself"

**Post:**
> **TL;DR:** Burned out hard, built a simple 1-min daily check-in tool, 50 beta users, 20% premium conversion. Validation: We're not crazy—burnout is real.
>
> Full story:
>
> Last year I hit the wall. Working 60h/week remotely, "asynchronous communication" = always on, isolation, no community feedback. Classic founder burnout.
>
> Therapist recommended journaling. I hate journaling.
>
> So I built: 1-minute check-in (stress, sleep, focus) + dashboard showing 30-day trends + pattern alerts.
>
> Tested with 50 friends. 20% upgraded to premium for "Chat IA + expert access". 80% kept free tier, used daily.
>
> **Why it worked:** Not motivation. Not meditation apps. Just... metrics. Builders understand metrics. Once you SEE "low sleep = high stress", you optimize.
>
> **GTM:** Started with Reddit. Zero marketing. Organic word-of-mouth from early users.
>
> Launching publicly this week. Metrics:
> - Daily active: 50 users
> - Free→Premium: 20%
> - Day-7 retention: 70% (high-engagement users)
> - CAC: €0 (organic only)
>
> Questions for this community: What's the biggest barrier to wellness tools for founders/remote workers? Features we're missing?

**Engagement:** Transparent metrics, ask for feedback, reply to every comment in first 24h

---

### Thread #4: "Remote Work Isolation" (Thu 9 AM CET)
**Subreddit:** r/AskFrance  
**Title:** "Comment gérez-vous l'isolement du télétravail sur votre santé mentale?"

**Post:**
> Honest question: How many of you are isolated right now and NOT talking about it?
>
> Remote work looked amazing 4 years ago. Now I know the dark side:
> - No water cooler conversations
> - No real human feedback (just Slack reactions)
> - Working from home = home stops feeling like home
> - Time disappears. You blink and it's 6 PM and you haven't moved from your desk
>
> The burnout patterns I see in my data:
> - Stress spikes on days with <2 real conversations
> - Sleep quality drops when isolated 5+ days
> - Focus actually IMPROVES when you force 1 coffee break in person
>
> We normalize this. We say "I'm so productive at home" while our mental health tanks.
>
> What's your isolation trigger? What helps you stay sane?

**Engagement:** Vulnerability + data + invites answers

### Thread #5: "DIY Wellness Toolkit" (Fri 2 PM CET)
**Subreddit:** r/Startup, r/MentalHealthFr
**Title:** "Therapy is €80/hour. Here's my DIY burnout prevention toolkit (costs €12/mo)"

**Post:**
> **Budget crisis + mental health crisis + refused therapy = DIY solution**
>
> Therapist wanted €80/session, 1x/week = €320/mo. Nope.
>
> So I built:
>
> **The Stack:**
> 1. **Daily check-in (free):** 1 min, rate stress/sleep/focus. Reveal patterns.
> 2. **AI meditations (€0-11/mo):** 5 free + 50+ premium. Pick the one that matches TODAY'S energy.
> 3. **Dashboard analytics (free):** See your 30-day trend. "This week I was worse" = actionable.
> 4. **AI chat (€12/mo):** Not a therapist. Just... a place to vent that listens and suggests patterns.
>
> **Expected cost:** €12/mo vs €320/mo therapy
> **Reality:** €12 = baseline. If you want expert therapist access (matched with your patterns), €29.
> **Why it works:** Data-first. Meditation-second. Chat-third. Most people don't need a therapist; they need visibility + habit.
>
> Free tier covers 80% of use case. Premium = speed + expertise.
>
> Not a substitute for therapy if you're in crisis. But for "I'm burning out slowly and can't afford help"? This is real.
>
> Any other bootstrappers managing mental health on a budget?

**Engagement:** Practical utility + transparency + affordability angle
